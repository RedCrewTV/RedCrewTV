Hi! I'm currently studying business informatics at a German university.<br>
I am currently working on an open-source alternative to [ModelEngine](https://mythiccraft.io/index.php?resources/model-engine%E2%80%94ultimate-entity-model-manager-1-19-4-1-21-4.1213/) and [MythicMobs](https://mythiccraft.io/index.php?resources/mythicmobs.1/). Feel free to contact me!

```java
Me me = new Me();

System.out.printf("Hi! Im %s\n", me.getName());
System.out.printf("I mainly develop in %s, woops I meant %s\n", me.getPreferredLanguage(), me.getPreferredCodingLanguage());
System.out.printf("Im %d years old and have been programming for over %d years", me.getAge(), me.getDevelopingYears());
